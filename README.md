# ShapeOfADrum

What is the shape of a drum?

A square drum sounds different than one with the shape of an hexagon, even if they have the same area. 

A big circular drum sounds differently than a small circular drum. 

A Black Hole (which is also a kind of drum), sounds differently depending on its mass and also on its spin.

This is a simple Mathematica notebook where you can test some of this things. Please check [Wikipedia's page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_the_shape_of_a_drum) to read more about this very interesting question.

### Requirements

Needs [this QNM package](https://github.com/jredondoyuste/MathematicaQNM) in Mathematica (although it is probably easy to adapt to any other package that computes QNMs of rotating BHs).

Tested in Mathematica 13.1

Please file an Issue or a PR if you find a bug or there is something that can be improved.
